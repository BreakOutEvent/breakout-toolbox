This repository contains all the nifty little things which make our BreakOut-Dev-Live easier.

The entrypoint is the script `breakout-cli.sh`.

Executing `./breakout-cli.sh -h` will show the "man page" of this tool.

If you want to start a backend, just execute:

`./breakout-cli.sh -s backend -r 1.24.0`

To stop and remove the containers, execute:

`./breakout-cli.sh -k backend`

Have fun :-*

Made with love in Dresde, München, New York and San José.
